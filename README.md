# Water Pump Operational Status Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the operational status of water pumps across Tanzania using machine learning. By leveraging structured data, we seek to enhance decision-making in water infrastructure management, ensuring efficient maintenance and resource allocation.

## Business and Data Understanding
Access to clean water is crucial for public health and sustainable development. This project serves stakeholders such as the government and NGOs, who are responsible for maintaining and repairing water points. By predicting pump functionality, they can prioritize interventions and allocate resources efficiently. The dataset includes features like pump characteristics, geographic locations, and historical maintenance records.

## Modeling
XGBoost was selected for its efficiency, robustness, and ability to handle structured data effectively. To improve model performance, we tuned key hyperparameters such as the number of trees, tree depth, learning rate, and regularization terms using Grid Search and Random Search. These optimizations enhanced predictive accuracy while preventing overfitting.

## Evaluation
The model's performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. XGBoost outperformed other models, particularly in identifying non-functional water pumps, making it a valuable tool for proactive maintenance planning.

## Conclusion
By accurately predicting water pump functionality, this model provides actionable insights that can help government agencies and NGOs optimize maintenance schedules, reduce downtime, and improve access to clean water for communities in need.
