        "Access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental right and crucial for health and well-being.

        "\n",
        "Access to clean and reliable water sources is crucial for the health and well-being of communities. In Tanzania, waterpoints play an essential role in providing potable water, but many of these waterpoints face operational challenges. Some are fully functional, others operate but require repairs, and a significant number are non-functional, limiting access to safe drinking water. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a predictive model that can determine the operational status of waterpoints.\n",

        "By accurately identifying which water pumps are likely to fail or need repairs, we can proactively manage resources, improve maintenance planning, and ultimately enhance access to clean water across Tanzania. This initiative will contribute to sustainable water management practices and support the long-term goal of achieving water security for all.\n"

        "- **funder**: The entity or organization that funded the well construction.\n",
        "- **gps_height**: Altitude of the waterpoint in meters.\n",
        "- **longitude** and **latitude**: GPS coordinates of the waterpoint.\n",
        "- **population**: Estimated population around the well.\n",
        "- **public_meeting**: Boolean indicating if a public meeting was held for the waterpoint.\n",
        "- **construction_year**: Year when the waterpoint was constructed.\n",
        "- **extraction_type**: The method used for water extraction (e.g., handpump, motorized).\n",
        "- **management** and **management_group**: Details on how the waterpoint is managed.\n",
        "- **payment** and **payment_type**: Information on the cost of water usage.\n",
        "- **water_quality** and **quality_group**: Indicators of water quality.\n",
        "- **quantity** and **quantity_group**: Information on the water quantity available.\n",
        "- **source** and **source_type**: Source of the water (e.g., river, spring).\n",
        "- **waterpoint_type** and **waterpoint_type_group**: Type of waterpoint (e.g., communal standpipe, hand pump).\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. Handling Missing Values\n",
        "- Many features in the dataset contain missing values, particularly in fields such as `funder`, `installer`, `scheme_management`, and `scheme_name`.\n",
        "- For categorical fields, we replace missing values with 'Unknown' or an appropriate placeholder.\n",
        "- For numeric fields, we either use median or mean imputation depending on the distribution of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Encoding Categorical Variables\n",
        "- Since many features are categorical (e.g., `management`, `payment_type`, `water_quality`), they need to be converted into numeric representations.\n",
        "- We use one-hot encoding or label encoding based on the model requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Feature Engineering\n",
        "- To improve predictive power, we create new features from existing data. For example:\n",
        "  - **Year of operation** by subtracting `construction_year` from the recording year.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "### 4. Scaling and Normalization\n",
        "- For models sensitive to feature scaling, such as SVM or K-means, we normalize numerical features like `gps_height` and `amount_tsh` to ensure consistent scale across features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Splitting the Data\n",
        "- We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. A typical split of 80/20 is used to ensure ample training data while retaining a sufficient test set for evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "By executing these preparation steps, we aim to create a clean, structured, and enriched dataset that is ready for model training and accurate performance assessment.\n",

        "8. **payment_type** - Shows if users are paying for water, which may impact available funds for maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **water_quality** - Low water quality could indicate that the waterpoint is non-functional or poorly maintained.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **quantity** - Reflects the volume of water available; low quantities could signal operational issues.\n",
